This time I learned enough to create a bug-free smooth tile movement system. I started applying state machines and learned about implementing A* pathfinding

WASD to move
SPACE to shoot "electric hook" 
(I wanted to do something that wasn't an air pump. the idea was to later add electric effects but I think after a week I had to get the game done and not increase the scope too much)

Rocks spawn randomly
Each level increases the speed of the enemies, but also the chances of rocks spawning

The graphics are a bit all over the place, I made the tiles first from scratch using pixel graphics, same with the player character which is the TF2 engineer in pixel style.
For the enemies and the rocks I took screenshots in Garry's Mod with a greenscreen background, then used Blender for compositing all the images and making them transparent,
then turned them into spritesheets
